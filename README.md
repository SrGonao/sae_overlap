# Sparse Autoencoders Trained on the Same Data Learn Different Features
Acompanying code for our research on SAE feature overlap when trained on different seeds.

We provide a script to calculate the alignment between two SAEs using the hungarian algorithm, [hungarian_alignment.py](hungarian_alignment.py).
